- Sale approval and rejection workflow
- Automatic final payout generation
- Automatic payout adjustment on rejected sales
- User balance calculation
- Withdrawal processing with balance validation
- Payment transaction recording
- RESTful APIs

# Business Rules

## 1. Advance Payout

Every eligible sale receives an advance payout equal to **10% of the sale amount**.

Example

Sale Amount

```
1000
```

Advance Payout

```
100
```

---

## 2. Sale Approval

When a sale is approved:

- Sale status becomes **APPROVED**
- Remaining **90% payout** is generated

Example

Sale Amount

```
1000
```

Advance Payout

```
100
```

Final Payout

```
900
```

---

## 3. Sale Rejection

When a sale is rejected:

- Sale status becomes **REJECTED**
- Adjustment payout is generated (if applicable)

---

## 4. Withdrawals

A withdrawal is allowed only when:

- Requested amount > 0
- User has sufficient available balance

Otherwise an appropriate error response is returned.

---

## 5. Payment Transactions

Every successful withdrawal automatically creates a payment transaction record.

---

# Error Handling

The project uses centralized exception handling.

Custom exceptions include:

- ValidationException
- ResourceNotFoundException
- InsufficientBalanceException
- SaleAlreadyReconciledException

The API returns meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages.

---

# Example Requests

## Create Advance Payout

```http
POST /payouts/advance
```

```json
{
    "sale_id": 1
}
```

---

## Reconcile Sale

```http
POST /sales/1/reconcile
```

```json
{
    "approved": true
}
```

---

## Withdraw Money

```

```json
{
    "amount": 100
}
```

---

## Get User Balance

```http
GET /users/1/balance
```

---

# Testing

The project has been tested using:

- Swagger UI
- SQLite Database Verification
- Business Logic Test Scripts

Scenarios tested include:

- Advance payout creation
- Sale approval
- Sale rejection
- Balance calculation
- Successful withdrawals
- Insufficient balance validation
- Sale not found
- Already reconciled sale
- Database consistency

---
